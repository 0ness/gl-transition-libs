# My transition is slow to compile / run. how to optimize?

- get rid of branchs (no more ifs, avoid for loops if possible).
- it might just be you have a slower machine (the green/yellow/red ranges were testing on a Macbook Pro 2014)

# some transition don't run / I reached limits on my specific machine

- maybe you have an old computer? check http://webglreport.com/ and report it to us.

# what means *"invalid transition, it must render getFromColor / getToColor when progress = 0.0 / 1.0"* means?
