# general

- address the ratio problem in shaders. the hard part about it is getting the size as a uniform.
  - I'm considering having an utility in gl-react to get the size of a given texture "input".
 Â - for gl-transition-render CLI, it should be easy as we have the pixels size.
- write short blog post.

# bot

- it should mention people that contributed to a file when someone send a patch.

# website

- drop autofocus for filename because its not the important bit. Also the errors should probably be moved out of the editor status bar but under the input.
- on mobile the gallery crash on Android, the gallery probably need to be smaller based on device size? Actually i think it should be a carousel and where we reuse the divs, anything on React for that? On mobile also don't show the expand https://github.com/akiran/react-slick
- gallery needs to affect key with a relative index (the item index in the page) because we would be more efficient by reusing the canvas when paginating
- bezier-easing-editor to implement touch events support
- drop font awesome because its not loading nicely. Instead should use svg like material-ui do?
- add a global loader because the site is weird if images aren't loaded.
- improve the input to be more "number inputs" ?
- more responsive editor. check it works on mobile.
- each error should be documented somewhere so we can link them in a FAQ kind of doc.
- experiment with video
- expandable EditorStatusBar
- should prevent nav everytime we "lose" content like when editing an existing shader (if !=). for the creation it's probably ok to leave because a "back" would restore the state.
- editor: a button to reset the defaults & also visually see if you have diverged from the default.
- nicely degrade screens when WebGL is not supported.
- customize gallery/editor imgs? old idea: https://github.com/gre/transitions.glsl.io/issues/585
- profile performance.

# glsl-transition -> gl-transition

glsl-transition was the "v1" format, it was a full fragment shader. the v2 is now called gl-transition and is more essential: just a transition(uv) color function to implement, decoupling solving issues like handling the from/to ratio.

all the old "glsl-transition*" libs will become DEPRECATED in favor of the new gl-transition* versions.
